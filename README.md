# Krazy Kanban Board

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to test my capibilities with full stack react. I built this project was to create a simple and easy spot to track tasks from the start to completion. This helps to keep tasks organized and tracked throughout the process of accomplishing them. I learned how to better work with routing between client and server side codes.
